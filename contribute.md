# How to contribute to Pinc

## Choose what to do
I've left plenty of "easy" TODOs everywhere, you'll probably come across a fairly simple one to get you started. Of course, you can always choose something more dificult! Just make sure it hasn't already been fixed, or that nobody is already working on a fix for it. Send me an email (bluesillybeard2@gmail.com) if you are unsure.

## Make a fork

Fork off the master branch, the dev branch exists for when I'm in the middle of something and it doesn't compile. You already know how to do this. If you don't, Pinc is not the right project for you to work on.

## Set up the development environment

Clone your fork (or switch to your fork if you're already cloned the repo). If your issue is platform specific, I suggest using that platform to set up the environment since you would have to be some kind of insane lunatic to try and do cross-platform debugging.

I suggest using Zig 0.13, although anything between 0.13.0 and the master version has a good chance of working. If the example compiles and runs, then your environment is good to go.

## Code the contribution

Generally, follow Zig's style guidlines and try to keep your code similar to what is already there. Don't sweat it, we don't do nitpicks around here.

## Submit a poll request

I'm sure you're familiar with what happens after this point.
